Short description of this project: 

15 minutes app (name tbd)

Suggestive app that fills different time slots for your day:

-user chooses their available block of time
-site suggests options: split into four main categories:
— physical health
— intellectual health
— nutrition 
— emotional health/ interacting with others 

Main page would display symbols from the four options
You can click into each category, it opens a new app

App2

Features that app- and small blurb on the suggested activity
MVP:
randomizer suggests 1 of 3 options within that category, grabs from the array, and assets created for each of those options.  

Clicking in to each category triggers consistent animation 

Local storage utilized that browser remembers the last thing you chose and randomizer won’t suggest the same thing twice.
